# Financial Dashboard
A simple Stock Dashboard in React, Redux using Sagas to deal with the state and async actions.
Also uses selectors.

## Stock prices
I am using the IEX API and fetching realtime stock prices for ticker symbols that can be setup in the web interface.

## Local storage
The watchlist and state of the app is persisted using local storage
